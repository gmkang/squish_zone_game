# Squish Zone 
- The program simulates and generates a horde of pesky bugs that invade your home. Skillfully maneuver your mouse and swat the bugs away. Practice your clicking and mousing skills with this satisfying exterminating game. Time is limited so effectively squish all the bugs in sight!

## Technologies Used
- Javascript
- jQuery
- HTML
- CSS
- With the use of DOM manipulation, I used Javascript and jQuery to assemble my game. Both of these essential languages helped me add event listeners, toggle through classes, incorporate a timer and offered various methods to create a more user friendly interface. HTML was used as the basis of my webpage and a lot of CSS was added for asthetics/visualization. 

## How To Play
- Quickly click on the little critters to exterminate them as fast you can before the swarm of bugs roll through. 
- Accumulate 150 points and receive a deathly can of bug spray! Once you see a can of "Buzz Off" spray at the bottom right corner of your screen, the potent concotion will be available for use. Activate the bug spray with a simple spacebar press and mouseover the invaders to teach them a lesson. 
- The goal is to elimate all the bugs before the timer runs out. 
 	-Ants = 5 points 
	-Flies = 10 points
