## Squish_Zone_Game
- The program simulates and generates a horde of pesky bugs that invade your home. Skillfully maneuver your mouse and swat the bugs away. Practice your clicking and mousing skills with this satisfying terminating game. Time is limited so effectively terminate all the bugs in sight!

# Technologies Used
- Javascript
- jQuery
- HTML
- CSS
- I interchangabely used Javascript and jQuery to assemble my game together. Adding event listeners, successfully working with methods and toggling classes to appropriately render squished bug effects, accumulate score and keeping track of the time left. HTML was used as the basis of my webpage and a lot of CSS was added for greater user experience/visualization. 

# How To Play
- Quickly click on the little critters to terminate them as fast you can before the swarm of bugs roll through. 
- Accumulate a 150 points and receive a deathly can of bug spray! Once you see a can of "Buzz Off" spray at the bottom right hand corner of your screen, the potent concotion will be available for use. Activate the bug spray with a simple spacebar press and mouseover the invaders to teach them a lesson. 
- The goal is to elimate all the bugs before the timer runs out. 
 	-Ants = 5 points 
	-Flies = 10 points
